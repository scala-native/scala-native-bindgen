We will use native.Zone to allocate struct (more information on memory management can be found here: Scala Native memory management).\nGenerated bindings contain helper functions that make struct allocation easier. To import them use import org.example.vector._\nLet’s create two points and the first line segment:\nimport org.example.vector._\nimport scala.scalanative.native.Zone\n\nZone { implicit zone =>\n  val p1 = struct_point(1, 1)\n  val p2 = struct_point(7, 4)\n\n  val lineSegment1 = struct_lineSegment(p1, p2)\n}\nThere is no need to create points manually, just call struct_lineSegment constructor and set point coordinates using fields setters.\nScala Native allows us to access a field by using _N method where N is index of a field (see Scala Native memory layout types) but it is not convenient because we have to match indices with fields names.\nBindgen provides implicit helper classes that wrap calls to _N in functions with meaningful names. To import these classes add import org.example.vector.implicits._ to your code:\nimport org.example.vector.implicits._\n\nval lineSegment2 = struct_lineSegment()\n\nlineSegment2.a.x = 3\nlineSegment2.a.y = 4\nlineSegment2.b = struct_point(5, 0)\nNote Note that struct_lineSegment contains fields of value type struct_point but setters accept variables of type native.Ptr[struct_point]. It helps to avoid Scala Native limitation that does not allow passing structs and arrays by value (see scala-native/scala-native#555).\nNow we can calculate angel between line segments:\nprintln(cosine(lineSegment1, lineSegment2))","title":"Using Generated Bindings"},{"location":"/integrating-bindings.html","text":"","title":"Integrating Bindings"},{"location":"/integrating-bindings.html#integrating-bindings","text":"To reuse already generated bindings create a config.json file that defines which headers correspond to which Scala objects:\n{\n  \"_stdio.h\": \"scala.scalanative.native.stdio\",\n  \"/full/path/to/regexp4.h\": \"bindings.regexp4\"\n}\nBindgen assumes that type names in header files match type names in generated binding (spaces in struct, union and enum names are replaces with underscores), but it is possible to specify custom names mapping:\n{\n  \"hiredis.h\": {\n    \"object\": \"bindings.hiredis.hiredis\",\n    \"names\": {\n      \"redisContext\": \"Context\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nProvide a path to config.json to bindgen using --binding-config command-line option or NativeBinding.bindingConfig sbt plugin option (see Using the sbt plugin).","title":"Integrating Bindings"},{"location":"/limitations.html","text":"","title":"Limitations"},{"location":"/limitations.html#limitations","text":"There are multiple unsupported cases that should be considered when generating bindings.\nPassing structs by value Limited support of #defines Reusing generated bindings Type qualifiers Updating extern variables","title":"Limitations"},{"location":"/limitations.html#passing-structs-by-value","text":"Scala Native does not support passing structs by value, bindgen skips such functions.\nstruct MyStruct {\n    int a;\n};\n\nstruct MyStruct returnStruct(); // skipped\n\nvoid handleStruct(struct MyStruct mystr); // skipped\nTo support such cases one should generate bindings for C wrapper functions that use pointers to structs instead of actual structs.","title":"Passing structs by value"},{"location":"/limitations.html#limited-support-of-defines","text":"#defines for literals and variables are supported.
