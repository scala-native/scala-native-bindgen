We will use native.Zone to allocate struct (more information on memory management can be found here: Scala Native memory management).\nHelper object mylibHelpers contains function for struct allocation. To import it use import mylibHelpers._\nLet’s create points for first vector:\nimport mylibHelpers._\nimport scala.scalanative.native.Zone\n\nobject Hello extends App {\n  Zone { implicit zone =>\n   val vec1p1 = struct_point()\n   val vec1p2 = struct_point()\n  }\n}\nNow we want to set fields of created points. Scala Native provides access to fields by using _N methods where N is index of a field (see Scala Native memory layout types).\nBindgen generates implicit helper classes that wrap calls to _N in functions with meaningful names. We already imported helper class, so we can use the functions:\nvec1p1.x = 0\nvec1p1.y = 1\n\nvec1p2.x = 6\nvec1p2.y = 3\nLets create first vector. Note that struct_vector contains fields of type struct_point but setters accept variables of type native.Ptr[struct_point]. It helps to avoid Scala Native limitation that does not allow passing structs and arrays by value (see scala-native/scala-native#555).\nval vec1 = struct_vector()\nvec1.a = vec1p1\nvec1.b = vec1p2\nRepeat these steps to create second vector. Once both vectors are created we can call add function and print the result:\nval vec3 = mylib.add(vec1, vec2)\nprintln(s\"(${vec3.a.x}, ${vec3.a.y}), (${vec3.b.x}, ${vec3.b.y})\")","title":"Using Generated Bindings"}]}
